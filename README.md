Here is my work for my pool at 42. Unfortunately, I could not import everything, so this code dates from when I was doing the day05, not finalized here.

The first two days are for the shell, and the others are for the C.

| Days | Percentage of success |
| - | - |
| *Day00* | 100% |
| *Day01* | 100% |
| *Day02* | 100% |
| *Day03* | 100% |
| *Day04* | 100% |
| *Day05* | 75% |
| *Day09* | 40% |

Don't cheat. ;)
