Here is my work for my pool at 42. Unfortunately, I could not import everything, so this code dates from when I was doing the day05, not finalized here.

The first two days are for the shell, and the others are for the C.

| Days | Percentage of success |
| - | - |
| Day00 | 100% |
| Day01 | 100% |
| Day02 | 100% |
| Day03 | 100% |
| Day04 | 100% |
| Day05 | 75% |
| Day09 | 40% |

Don't cheat. ;)
